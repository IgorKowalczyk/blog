# Development
To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

To test the blog, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at http://localhost:4000/dir/. This starts a Jekyll server using content in the `dir/` directory. As modifications are made to the theme and test site, it will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.

# Pull Requests
When submitting a pull request:

- Clone the repo.
